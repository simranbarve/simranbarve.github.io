      I'm a student and aspiring software engineer who loves to solve
      problems that are fundamental to computer science.
      Computer Scientists solve real-life problems that help people in their day to day life.
      Right now I am working on developing my skills through courses such as Harvard's CS50.
      I am also working on a meal planning website for my final project.

      I participated in World Challenge which forced me to test my limits and
      get out of my comfort zone. It required me to help the team budget and
      organise large parts of the trip such as accommodation and activities
      we did. This improved my sills of thinking on the spot as often things
      did not go to plan, and we would have to improvise with whatever money
      we had and try and create a substantial meal for 20 people.
      While playing the piano and violin for six years each, I developed a
      love for the sound and feel of music. The consistency of lessons and
      practise helped me learn how to manage my time incorporating personal
      and professional time into my schedule.
