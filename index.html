    <p>
      I'm a student and aspiring software engineer who loves to solve
      problems that are fundamental to computer science.
      Computer Scientists solve real-life problems that help people in their day to day life.
      Right now I am working on developing my skills through courses such as Harvard's CS50.
      I am also working on a meal planning website for my final project.
